               <h2>Walter White</h2>
               <p>
                  Walter Hartwell "Walt" White Sr., also known by his
                  clandestine pseudonym and business moniker
                  <em>Heisenberg</em>
                  and also frequently referred to as Mr. White, is a former
                  chemist and major narcotics distributor from Albuquerque, New
                  Mexico, whose drug empire became the largest meth operation in
                  American history, surpassing both Gustavo Fring's drug empire
                  and the Cartel's. Before entering the drug trade, Walt was a
                  respected chemist and scientist who later worked as an
                  overqualified high school chemistry teacher at J. P. Wynne
                  High School alongside working at the A1A Car Wash to
                  financially support his family (his wife Skyler, son Walt Jr.,
                  and infant daughter Holly). After being diagnosed with
                  terminal lung cancer, Walt started manufacturing chemically
                  pure crystal methamphetamine to provide for his family upon
                  his death. Knowing nothing about the drug trade, Walt enlisted
                  the aid of his former student, Jesse Pinkman, to sell the meth
                  he produced.

               <h2>Jesse Pinkman</h2>
               <p>
                  Jesse Bruce Pinkman, also known by his clandestine pseudonym
                  and business moniker <em>Cap'n Cook</em>, is a former chemist,
                  manufacturer, and distributor who worked in Albuquerque, New
                  Mexico, currently residing in Haines, Alaska. Originally a
                  low-level methamphetamine dealer who worked with his friend
                  and fellow meth cook Emilio Koyama, Jesse is best known as the
                  former business and meth cook partner of his former chemistry
                  teacher Walter White, teaming up with Walt for two years to
                  help him manufacture chemically pure crystal methamphetamine
                  so Walt could provide for his family (his wife Skyler, son
                  Walt Jr., and infant daughter Holly) upon his death. Alongside
                  catalyzing Walt's drug empire and being the second biggest
                  player in it after Walt himself, Jesse was also the leader of
                  a short-lived meth distribution chain which his friends and
                  fellow meth distributors were also a part of.
